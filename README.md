# HackerSifu's Command Cheat Sheet
This is a collection of commands that I've found helpful, and a lot of times end up reusing (and trying to find them again in some of these cases as well). I'll continue to add to this list, and feel free to provide any suggestions or additions.

### Adding text to the end of each line in a file:
```
sed -e 's/$/<text to insert here>/' -i <filename>.txt
```

### Uncompressing tar files:
```
tar -xvf <filename>
```

### Adding text to the end of a file name:
```
echo '<text to insert here>' >> <filename>
```

### Redirecting stdout to a file, as well as redirecting stderr to stdout:
```
<command> >out 2>&1
```

### One liner update command (Debian):
```
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
```
